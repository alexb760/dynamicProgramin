This repository split up in two parts Memoization and Tabulation

## Memoization (Think recursively)
1. Gets the small input of the problem and other input just a bit biger
2. draw a solution more like a strategy this in terms of a tree.
3. Write your code in your loved lenguage.
### 4. make it works.
4.1. visulize the problem as a tree.

4.2. implement the tree using resursion (Brute force solution) --> get valid result.

### 5. make it efficient
5.1. implement Memoization object.

5.2. Identifie patters in the tree so that can be stored in the memo object.

5.3. Add the best case scenario to return from the memo object.

5.4. Add the repeted values in the memo object.

## Tabulation (Think Iteratively)
1. visualize the problem as a table.

2. size tge table base on the inputs.

3. initialize the table with default values this base on what is intended to return and which value is the best scenario to return.

4. seed the trivial answer into the table.

5. Iterate through the table.

6. Fill further position based on the current position.

## Wraping up.
Decide what is the trivially smallest input from here you can chose ether Memoization or Tabulation hightly recomend draw your strategy first before satart coding.
